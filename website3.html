            <h2>What is the Peregrine Falcon?</h2>
            <p>

                Falconidae family. The Peregrine is bird is more commonly noted by its speed and aerial skills,
                being the fastest member in the animal kingdom. The Peregrine can be found everywhere around the
                world accept extreme polar regions.
            </p>

            <h3>What does it eat?</h3>
            <p>
                The Peregrine Falcon only feeds on exclusively on medium-sized birds such as pigeons, doves,
                waterfowl, songbirds, and waders. How ever in urban areas the Peregrine's diet is made up of the
                Rock or Feral Pigeon, which in some cities is 80% of thier diet.
            </p>

            <h3>Reproduction</h3>
            <p>
                Reproduction of the Peregrine falcon occurs around when its 2-3 years old, when its sexually matured.
                During the breeding season the Peregrine is territorial. Within a breeding territory, a pair may have
                several nesting ledges; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two to seven in a 16 year period.
                The pair will have to defend their choosen nesting sites from other Peregrines and other birds like
                ravens and herons. When their chicks hatch (<em>Also called egrets</em>) they both leave for pray for
                their young.
